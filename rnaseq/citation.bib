  abstract="RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology---the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.",

  abstract = {Critical cancer mutations are often regional and mosaic, confounding the efficacy of targeted therapeutics. Single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled unprecedented studies of intra-tumor heterogeneity and its role in cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. When coupled with DNA sequencing, scRNA-seq allows one to infer the in vivo impact of genomic alterations on gene expression. This combination can be used to reliably distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic cells, to correlate paracrine-signaling pathways between neoplastic cells and stroma, and to map expression signatures to inferred clones and phylogenies. Here we review recent advances in scRNA-seq, with a special focus on cancer. We discuss the challenges and prospects of combining scRNA-seq with DNA sequencing to assess intra-tumor heterogeneity. },

	abstract = {Single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) differs from bulk RNASeq in that a large number of genes have zero reads in some cells, but relatively high expression in the remaining cells. We propose that these zeros, or dropouts, are due to failure of the reverse transcription, and we model the process using the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation. We show that the MM equation provides an equivalent or superior fit to existing scRNASeq datasets compared to other models. In addition, identifying genes significantly to the right of the MM curve is a fast and accurate method to distinguish differentially expressed genes without prior identification of subpopulations of cells. We applied our method to a mouse preimplantation dataset and demonstrate that clustering the selected genes identifies biologically meaningful clusters. Furthermore, this feature selection makes it possible to overcome batch effects and cluster cells from five different datasets by their biological groups rather than by experimental origin.},
